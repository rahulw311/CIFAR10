# CIFAR10
Different models implemented on the CIFAR10 dataset

Please download the CIFAR10 dataset in order to use this notebook.

In this project I have made use of ResNet with the Adam Optimizer and applied it to the CIFAR10 dataset.

I have also implemented the following augmentations from scratch-
1. Cutout Augmentation
2. Standard Augmentation
3. Mixup Augmentation

This was implemented as part of my course work under Professor Samet Oymak as part of a course I completed on Deep Learning.
